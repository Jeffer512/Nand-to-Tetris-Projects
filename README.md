# Nand to Tetris Projects

This repository contains my projects for the "Nand to Tetris" course. In this course, I built a modern computer system, starting from elementary logic gates and progressing to a compiler for a Java-like programming language, and a basic operating system.

## Course Overview

"Nand to Tetris" is divided into two parts:

- Part I focuses on hardware projects, where I built a set of 15 elementary logic gates and utilized these gates to design more complex chips in HDL. This includes key components of a computer system such as memory, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
- Part II focuses on software projects, where I implemented a virtual machine, a compiler for a simple, Java-like programming language, and developed a basic operating system.

## Projects

Here are the projects I completed for each part of the course:

- Part I (Hardware projects)
    - Boolean Logic
    - Boolean Arithmetic
    - Memory
    - Machine Language Programming
    - Computer Architecture
    - Assembler

- Part II (Software projects)
    - Virtual Machine
    - High-Level Language
    - Compiler
    - Operating System

## Skills Acquired

Through these projects, I gained a deep, hands-on understanding of numerous topics in applied computer science, such as computer architecture, stack processing, parsing, code generation, and classical algorithms and data structures for memory management, vector graphics, input-output handling, and various other topics that lie at the very core of every modern computer system.
